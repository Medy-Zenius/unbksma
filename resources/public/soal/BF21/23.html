I had a really messed up middle school experience. My mom moved me and my sibs to Illinois to be with her new husband and his mom, who were super controlling and lazy. She made up super strict rules and wouldn't even criticize us on how we walked and sat and poured cereal. She was obsessive about every little thing we did. She would force me to eat large quantities of food at each meal time, twice as much as I was used to eating because she said that I should be ashamed of my figure. I was skinny, and not interested in boys, I wore baggier clothes because if I ever wore fitting jeans or t shirts she would call me a slut.
<br><br>
She would psychologically abuse me a lot by dictating every moment of my day. I wasn't allowed to go outside. My sibs and I would sit in a cluttered dining room all day where we could only sit and maybe color or talk softly. And at night we would lay down sleeping bags and sleep there. It was rough and depressing for all my siblings and me, we were constantly afraid of doing one thing wrong to displease her. Always not wanting to take the blame for a pencil that fell off the table or a sock we accidentally dropped because that could result in a month of being grounded to the table.
<br><br>
Eventually I started cutting myself because I figured my life wasn't important. The day I hit rock bottom though was when my autistic brother snapped and started trying to stab himself with a pencil. He kept yelling that he wanted to die and was crying and I was trying to calm him down because it broke my heart because I wanted to die too, but I didn't want him or my siblings to though.
<br><br>
A few months later we moved out of that place and are much better now. We are not under any sort of crazy discipline or mental abuse anymore. But it took a lot of therapy to get over my nervous habits and things I developed such as anxiety attacks and bulimia. Things are normal now, but the way my grand ma treated me in those years are still memories I wish never existed.
