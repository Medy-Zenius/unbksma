<br><br>An alleged sexual abuse case was revealed on Monday in an international school in South Jakarta involving the alleged gang rape of a six-year-old student by cleaning service staff. The victim was reportedly subjected to rape by several members of the school’s outsourced cleaning staff on two separate occasions in the period Feb. 20 to March 20, in one of the toilets at the school.
<br><br>
The case was uncovered after the victim’s mother uncovered bruises on the child’s stomach and anus on March 20. The mother said the child had exhibited abnormal behavior around Feb. 20 to 23. “When my son told me of the incidents, I struggled to understand at first, but it gradually became clear he had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of several adults at the school,” the mother said in a press conference at the Sari Kuring restaurant in Central Jakarta.
<br><br>
The mother said she took the child to several medical centers, including Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital and Pondok Indah Hospital in South Jakarta, before filing a police report with the Jakarta Police on March 24. The results of the child’s examination at Pondok Indah Hospital confirmed the child’s injuries were consistent with sexual abuse and also indicated the child had contracted herpes.
