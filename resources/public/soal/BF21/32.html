When I interview for jobs and the money discussion comes up, I usually ask for way too much money.  Several factors contribute to this mistake.
<br><br>
First, like many, I have a large law school debt, so I thought I needed more money and I deserved to be paid “like a lawyer” because I am paying to be a lawyer.  After being out of law school for almost nine years, I realize that I can live on less than I thought even with the loans.  Not everyone has large loans.  It is not any employer’s fault that I have these loans or their responsibility to pay me more than the market will bear.  If other attorneys with equal qualifications are willing to take a job for less money, then they will likely get the job.  If other attorneys with greater qualifications are willing to take the job for less money, then they will almost certainly get the job.
<br><br>
Second, I went to school in the Washington DC area, and the salary figures I was hearing from my friends getting jobs in that area or in other major cities did not apply to the legal market in the Detroit area, or later the Fox River Valley, where I was seeking employment.  I should have been trying to get a more realistic idea of what young attorneys were making in the markets where I was seeking employment.
<br><br>
Lastly, and most importantly, I was asking for too much money because all the career advice that I was reading online was saying things to the effect of, “be careful not to ask for too little.”  I thought if I asked for too little it would show how little I knew.  It’s actually quite the opposite.  Asking for a reasonable salary shows that you understand the market you are entering, which is huge if the employer is looking for a future partner rather than simply an employee.  One of the more senior shareholders in my firm still gets ribbed for asking if there was a signing bonus when he got hired as a young lawyer.
<br><br>
Thus, based on the above reasons I will never regret for my failure in any job interviews. I do trust that I will get the highest salary I dream.
