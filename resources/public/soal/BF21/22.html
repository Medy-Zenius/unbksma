The Jakarta Education Agency has urged an international school to take responsibility and acknowledged its operational weaknesses after one of its kindergarten pupils was gang raped at the school, while the Education and Culture Ministry plans to send an investigation team to the school.
<br><br>
The case, involving the sexual assault of a six-year-old by three cleaning staff members at an international school in South Jakarta, has gained considerable attention from the public and the media, some of which have published sensitive information, including the mother’s full name and identity.
<br><br>
Education and Culture Minister Mohammad Nuh said he would send a team to the school to investigate its management system. “The school has a responsibility to protect its students from such incidents,” Nuh said as quoted by tribunnews.com.
<br><br>
Child psychologist Tiwin Herman suggested on Tuesday that the case should not have been exposed via a press conference, as exposing the case to the media would only harm the victim’s already fragile mental state.
<br><br>
Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said investigators came to the school on Tuesday to help the victim confirm and identify two more cleaning staff possibly related to the case. He added that the police had asked the school to divulge information on the backgrounds workers at the school to identify if they were free of major diseases or mental illnesses. Rikwanto said the three suspects, Afriska, Virgiawan and Agun Iskandar, would be charged under Article 292 of the Criminal Code and Article 82 of the Child Protection Law, and faced up to 15 years in prison each.

The victim’s mother elaborated on Monday that she and her lawyer were not considering legal action against the school until the investigation into the case had concluded.
