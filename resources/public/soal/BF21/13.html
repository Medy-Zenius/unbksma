    Nineteen days after it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, there are still few facts that point to what exactly happened to Flight
MH370.
</p>
<p>
It is known that the jet's communication and tracking systems - the transponder, and the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System or ACARS - were turned off deliberately.
</p>
<p>
This happened as the Boeing 777-200ER was leaving Malaysian airspace and entering Vietnamese territory. Shortly after, it diverted from its original
flight path.
</p>
<p>
   The last satellite transmission was at 8:11am on March 8 - 6Â½ hours after Malaysian air traffic control lost contact with the jet. Until that point, there was no distress signal from the cockpit.
</p>
<p>
  On Monday night, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak confirmed, based on analysis of satellite data, that the plane had plunged into the Indian Ocean with zero chance of survivors.
