With the advent of globalization, international marriages have been more popular these days. However, there are multiple downsides of this trend than marrying native of one’s own country, which will now be explained.
<br><br>
The strongest argument against such marriage could be language barrier. To illustrate, a Sri Lankan man might find it difficult to communicate effectively with his Chinese wife if he has limited language skill. If such couple has limited language proficiency, they would have difficulty expressing their feelings, instead may end up their conversation with dissatisfaction and misunderstandings.
<br><br>
The other disadvantage of getting married with overseas foreigner could be a cultural shock. It is well known that the tradition and customs of different countries vary from one another. As from the example above, that Chinese lady is likely to face many difficulties getting used to her Sri Lankan in-laws’ lifestyle. This can lead to extreme discomfort and more family issues.
<br><br>
Admittedly, some maintain that tying knot with someone from foreign country could be more exciting as it is fun to explore each other’s undiscovered traditions and also it provides opportunities for international travel. However, this could be true for some couples but not always the case. Learning new etiquettes everyday could be more demanding. Likewise, there are growing issues of dual citizenships and visa problems.
<br><br>
To summarize, the drawbacks of an international wedding, such as language problem and difficulty in adjusting to foreign culture and tradition eventually outweigh its benefits. Therefore, I firmly believe that one should marry a citizen of one’s own nationality if he or she wants to avoid all those/these difficulties.
