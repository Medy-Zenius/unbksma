    <b>THE PRINCESS DIARIES</b>
    </p>
<p>
    As the hilariously funny tale called The Princess Diaries begins, Mia Thermopolis is just a regular high school freshman at Albert Einstein High School.
</p>
<p>
As readers can guess from the title, this book takes the form of a diary, written by Mia. Over the span of a month, she relates her daily woes and embarrassments in heart breaking detail. As with most teenaged girls, Mia thinks she is hopeless, looks-wise. One of Mia’s biggest problems is the fact she is flunking Algebra and, to make matters worse.
</p>

<p>
Then one day, Mia finds out she is a princess. Mia hates the idea instantly. How does this fairy tale come true? Her father is ruler of the principality of Genovia and since Mia is his only child, she is next in line to the throne. Her dad sends in the big guns to convince Mia that being a princess is what she is meant to do: her formidable grandmother comes to New York to give Mia “Princess Lessons”. Her life just gets crazier.
</p>
<p>
   The ending of The Princess Diaries is a twisty one and will leave you joining for more stories of Mia and the rest of her friends.
