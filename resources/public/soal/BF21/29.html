Enology is the term that is used to describe the science of winemaking.  This science has its roots in prehistoric times, as the effects of alcohol were probably discovered when rotten fruit was consumed and found to have an intoxicating effect.  Fermented liquid could be stored for a long time without fear of decomposition, and a reliable drinking source was obtained.
<br><br>
The process of fermentation is explained when yeast is added to a solution containing glucose, and the yeast cells convert the simple sugars to ethanol and carbon dioxide.  The alcoholic solution that results from fermentation contains about 12-15% ethanol, as yeast cells cannot survive in higher concentrations of ethanol.
High sugar content is necessary for fermentation to proceed in a desirable manner. Because of this, the sugar-rich species of grape Vitis vinifera is used for the majority of the wines produced around the world.
<br><br>
As many as 4000 varieties of Vitis Vinefera have been developed and are used in the production of wines.  Diversity and quality of wine results not only from the type of grape used, but also from the distinctive qualities of soil, topography, and climate.  Although the specifics of winemaking can vary from location to location and the individual fermenting techniques, the basic steps involved in winemaking are similar for most wineries.

   Why do wineries like to make wine from Vitis vinifera?
