    Nineteen days after it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, there are still few facts that point to what exactly happened to Flight
MH370.
</p>
<p>
It is known that the jet's communication and tracking systems - the transponder, and the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System or ACARS - were turned off deliberately.
</p>
<p>
This happened as the Boeing 777-200ER was leaving Malaysian airspace and entering Vietnamese territory. Shortly after, it diverted from its original
flight path.
</p>
<p>
   The last satellite transmission was at 8:11am on March 8 - 6Â½ hours after Malaysian air traffic control lost contact with the jet. Until that point, there was no distress signal from the cockpit.
</p>
<p>
  On Monday night, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak confirmed, based on analysis of satellite data, that the plane had plunged into the Indian Ocean with zero chance of survivors.

Where was the last position of the plane when it changed its original flight path?
