    James Mason, who appeared in two of Max Ophüls's <b>films</b>, once wrote a short poem about the director that begins: "A shot that does not call for tracks / Is agony for poor dear Max / Who separated from his dolly / Is wrapped in deepest melancholy." The luscious visual audacity of Letter from an Unknown Woman makes Mason's case perfectly.
<br><br>
    Swift, swooping, dizzying, <b><i>Max Ophüls’</i></b> shooting style matches brilliantly the vertiginous melodrama of his story. The lighting, too, intensifies the agonies of a doomed romance, as well as subtly accentuating the lovers' innocence and guilt: she is bathed in a beatific glow; he is forever in dubious shadow.
<br><br>
Set a century ago in Vienna, the story (based on the novella of the same name by Stefan Zweig) opens with a terrific grab at the heartstrings. The night before he is due to fight a duel, philandering concert pianist Stefan Brand (Louis Jourdan) receives a letter.
<br><br>
"By the time you read this," it begins, "I may be dead." The writer is Lisa Berndle (Joan Fontaine), with whom Stefan had a fling 10 years earlier. In a series of flashbacks, the story of her obsession with him (which began when she was a child living next door) is revealed.
<br><br>
Cruelly, Lisa's passion is unrequited; even worse, Stefan – befuddled by a lifetime's womanizing – has no idea who she is when she turns up at his apartment.
<br><br>
Weak-willed, selfish, exploitative, Stefan is certainly the villain of the piece. But Lisa's letter (which contains more than one bombshell) brings about a transformation, and, as dawn approaches, he heads towards his uncertain fate with newfound courage.
<br><br>
It is a heartbreaking yet strangely uplifting moment.
