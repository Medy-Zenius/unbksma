    <br>Long, long ago there lived a priest, who had a little baby. <br>Amazingly, his baby was a snake. <br>He ordered the snake to meditate in a mountain.

    One day, the people of the village went hunting for a wild animal, <br>for a village feast. They found a big snake and cut<br> it into pieces. They didn't know that it<br> was the priest's child. <br>The spirit of the snake became a small boy. <br>He begged for food when the villagers were having feast. <br>But no one cared for the boy. <br>The little boy then planted a stick.<br> When the stick was pulled out of the ground,<br> water sprang out of the hole. <br>Gradually it became a big flood. <br>All the villagers, except an old widow, were drowned.<br> She was saved because she had helped the little<br> boy by giving him some food and drink.       <br>(taken from www. egidia. com)
